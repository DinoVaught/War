===Git notes ==========
If you're in a bind (getting a repo initialized / configured) or are in a pickle 
you can just delete the .git directory and re=initialize (git init) the folder / project

'Adding' or 'staging' files to the index / repository 
See what files will be added or (staged) to the index (dry run) the 
( . ) periods key, wild card specifying all files, recursively.
git add (below) can also be used to see what your .gitignore is filtering 
- git add . --dry-run

Add a (git name) for (pushing code) to github
- git remote add wipMover 'github.com/DinoVaught/WIP_Mover'

Then, to start the push to the remote 
- git push wipMover

To see existing <remote names> that git already knows about
- git remote show


Create tag (example below)
git tag -a -m "v_1.0.0 This is the build just before I chopped all the automation code from this app" v_1.0.0

Push Tag to server
git push --tags https://github.com/DinoVaught/War


view list of indexed files
git ls-files

below remove files that have been (staged) and are already indexed
   (in vs code = terminal)
   1:   git rm --cached bin\x86\Debug\*.dll

   (get bash use 's on each end ot the path)
   2:   git rm --cached 'bin\x86\Debug\*.dll'

   remove all *.png files from the index.  
   yse --dry-run to 'see' which files will be targeted.
   3:   git rm *.png --cached --dry-run

in git documentation => items in [] are optional, and items in <> are parameters

====== Transition style notes==============================
When moving or transitioning an image (for example) - the transition will not occur when, the transition will be skipped when . . . 
Apparently the Transition style only works on properties of numeric types???
    * The images start and stop styles have not been set.  The Transition style has to know the (start) px (left and / or top) before the transition will occur.  The transition has to know the starting point
    * Transitions work by interpolating (from state A to state B). 
        - If using a single javascript function, a function that sets the Transition property AND changes the property 
          that triggers the transition, the transition will/may not occur.  
            * To force the layout engine to ((synchronize with) or (be aware of)) the 'recently set transition style' read 
              the elementâ€™s (.offsetHeight) property.  Apparently, by reading the elements .offsetHeight property all of the 
              element's properties and styles are refreshed and the ?browser? is made aware of the 'newly set Transition style'
